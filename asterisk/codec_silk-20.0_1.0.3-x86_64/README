SILK Software Codec for Asterisk README

==[ Installation Overview ]===================================================

  There are two ways to install codec_silk on your system

  The preferred way of installing the SILK codec is to use menuselect in
  Asterisk to automatically download and install the codec. From the Asterisk
  top-level source directory, run

  1) run `make menuselect`
  2) Highlight "Codec Translators" and press enter.
  3) Scroll down to "codec_silk" in the section labeled "External"
  4) Press enter to select the codec if it is not already selected.
  5) Press "x" to exit menuselect and save your selections.

  From here, build and install Asterisk as you normally would. When you run
  the `make install` step, codec_silk will automatically be downloaded and
  installed into the Asterisk module directory (by default,
  /usr/lib/asterisk/modules/).


  The alternative way to install codec_silk is to download a tarball
  directly from digium.com. Once the tarball is downloaded and untarred,
  move the codec_silk.so file into the Asterisk module directory (by default,
  /usr/lib/asterisk/modules/). The codec selector should ensure that you
  download the correct version of the codec for your version of Asterisk.


==[ Asterisk Configuration ]===================================================

  Asterisk can be given custom configuration instructions for the SILK codec
  using the codecs.conf file. By placing "type = silk" in a configuration
  section, that section will be recognized as having options relating to SILK.

  For a listing of SILK-related options, see the Asterisk wiki's listing of
  codecs.conf options or the sample codecs.conf file in the Asterisk source
  distribution.
